## Features

* An **interactive map** which lets you locate nearby available food resources. This map can be panned across to view different locations around the map. If an item is available at a particular location, a :pushpin: will appear on the map to show its availability. The [map]([https://kitchen2kitchen.herokuapp.com/#/main](https://kitchen2kitchen.herokuapp.com/#/main)) is displayed to the user when they login to the website with their credentials.

* A **search** functionality allowing the user to **filter** through a list of categories and look for **products** according to their needs. A variety of filters have been incorporated right now and more can be added accordingly.

* The website also features an interactive Login and Sign-Up function which allows the user to create an account using their own credentials. This allows the user to keep a track of their posted products as well as the status about the same. The user can also toggle the status for a product (whether the product has been sold off or depleted).
